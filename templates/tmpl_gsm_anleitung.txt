[set_font 62]GSM Registration[set_font 0]

Starting with 27C3 the GSM handset
registration is managed as self-service.
Just follow this simple two-step process:

1. Register a new extension with phone
type "GSM". Give the system a couple
of minutes to synchronize with our
in-house GSM provider. Relax. Maybe have a
nip of your favorite caffeinated beverage.

2. You have to use the special sim card,
sold at the previous CCC events or just
buy a new one.

3. Place a call to the number of the GSM
token shown in the details view of your
extension. This step completes the
registration process and pairs your
device/SIM with the event's GSM network.
If you ever feel like switching devices
or SIM cards, then just redial this number
on your new device.

Of course, the registration can only
succeed when operating within the correct
GSM network, so please make sure your
network provider has been selected
accordingly before dialing any number.
Selecting a network named 31C3 or some
binary digits is probably not the
worst choice.
